## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd automot-hub-main

# Apply the migration
npx supabase db push
```

Or manually:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d your_database -f supabase/migrations/20250913000001_merchant_system_updated.sql
```

### Step 2: Test Merchant Registration

1. Navigate to `/auth` page
2. Click "Sign Up" tab
3. See "Register as a Merchant" link
4. Click it to go to `/merchant-register`
5. Use one of the demo codes:
   - `MERCHANT2024`
   - `DEALER100`
   - `WORKSHOP50`
   - `VIP001`

### Step 3: Approve a Test Merchant

```sql
-- View pending applications
SELECT id, company_name, created_at
FROM merchant_registrations
WHERE status = 'PENDING';

-- Approve one
UPDATE merchant_registrations
SET status = 'APPROVED', approved_at = now()
WHERE id = 'paste_id_here';
```

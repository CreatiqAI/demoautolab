# Merchant System Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the complete merchant system implementation including registration with access codes, wallet/points system, bulk pricing, promotions, and differentiated dashboards.

## Database Changes

### 1. Run the Migration

Apply the merchant system migration:

```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
npx supabase db push

# Or apply the migration file directly
psql -U postgres -d your_database -f supabase/migrations/20250913000000_merchant_system.sql
```

### 2. Database Schema Created

The migration creates the following tables:

- **merchant_codes** - Access codes for merchant registration
- **merchant_registrations** - Merchant application details
- **merchant_wallets** - Points and credit balances
- **wallet_transactions** - Transaction history
- **bulk_pricing_tiers** - Quantity-based pricing
- **merchant_promotions** - Exclusive promotions
- **promotion_usage** - Promotion usage tracking
- **merchant_favorites** - Quick reorder items
- **merchant_purchase_history** - Purchase analytics

### 3. Sample Access Codes Created

The migration automatically creates these demo codes:
- `MERCHANT2024` - General merchant registration (unlimited uses)
- `DEALER100` - Dealer program (100 slots)
- `WORKSHOP50` - Workshop partner (50 slots)
- `VIP001` - VIP invitation (10 slots)

## Admin Tasks

### Create New Merchant Access Code

```sql
INSERT INTO public.merchant_codes (code, description, max_uses, is_active)
VALUES ('YOUR_CODE', 'Description of the code', 100, true);
```

### Approve Merchant Application

```sql
-- This will automatically:
-- 1. Update user role to 'merchant'
-- 2. Create merchant wallet
UPDATE public.merchant_registrations
SET status = 'APPROVED',
    approved_at = now(),
    approved_by = 'admin_user_id_here'
WHERE id = 'registration_id_here';
```

### Reject Merchant Application

```sql
UPDATE public.merchant_registrations
SET status = 'REJECTED',
    rejection_reason = 'Reason for rejection'
WHERE id = 'registration_id_here';
```

### View Pending Merchant Applications

```sql
SELECT
  mr.id,
  mr.company_name,
  mr.business_type,
  mr.status,
  mr.created_at,
  p.full_name,
  p.phone_e164,
  mc.code as access_code_used
FROM merchant_registrations mr
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = mr.user_id
JOIN merchant_codes mc ON mc.id = mr.code_id
WHERE mr.status = 'PENDING'
ORDER BY mr.created_at DESC;
```

### Add Points to Merchant Wallet

```sql
-- Add bonus points to a merchant
DO $$
DECLARE
  v_wallet_id UUID;
  v_new_balance NUMERIC;
BEGIN
  -- Get wallet ID and current balance
  SELECT id, points_balance INTO v_wallet_id, v_new_balance
  FROM merchant_wallets
  WHERE user_id = 'merchant_user_id_here';

  -- Calculate new balance
  v_new_balance := v_new_balance + 100.00;

  -- Update wallet
  UPDATE merchant_wallets
  SET points_balance = v_new_balance,
      total_earned_points = total_earned_points + 100.00
  WHERE id = v_wallet_id;

  -- Record transaction
  INSERT INTO wallet_transactions (
    wallet_id,
    user_id,
    type,
    amount,
    balance_after,
    description
  ) VALUES (
    v_wallet_id,
    'merchant_user_id_here',
    'EARN_BONUS',
    100.00,
    v_new_balance,
    'Promotional bonus points'
  );
END $$;
```

### Create Bulk Pricing Tier

```sql
-- Example: Add bulk pricing for a product
-- 10-49 units: 5% off merchant price
-- 50-99 units: 10% off
-- 100+ units: 15% off

INSERT INTO public.bulk_pricing_tiers (product_id, min_quantity, max_quantity, price, discount_percentage, is_active)
SELECT
  p.id,
  10,
  49,
  p.price_merchant * 0.95,
  5.00,
  true
FROM products p WHERE p.sku = 'YOUR-SKU'
UNION ALL
SELECT
  p.id,
  50,
  99,
  p.price_merchant * 0.90,
  10.00,
  true
FROM products p WHERE p.sku = 'YOUR-SKU'
UNION ALL
SELECT
  p.id,
  100,
  NULL, -- NULL means unlimited
  p.price_merchant * 0.85,
  15.00,
  true
FROM products p WHERE p.sku = 'YOUR-SKU';
```

### Create Merchant Promotion

```sql
-- Example: 20% off orders above RM2000
INSERT INTO public.merchant_promotions (
  code,
  name,
  description,
  type,
  discount_value,
  min_purchase_amount,
  max_discount_amount,
  applicable_to,
  valid_from,
  valid_until,
  max_uses,
  is_active
) VALUES (
  'BULK20',
  'Bulk Purchase Discount',
  'Get 20% off on orders above RM2000',
  'PERCENTAGE_DISCOUNT',
  20.00,
  2000.00,
  500.00, -- Max RM500 discount
  'ALL',
  now(),
  now() + INTERVAL '90 days',
  NULL, -- Unlimited uses
  true
);
```

### Update Merchant Tier

```sql
-- Upgrade merchant to GOLD tier with higher points rate
UPDATE public.profiles
SET merchant_tier = 'GOLD',
    points_rate = 1.5 -- Earn 1.5 points per RM
WHERE id = 'merchant_user_id_here'
  AND role = 'merchant';
```

### View Merchant Analytics

```sql
-- Get merchant spending summary
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.full_name,
  mr.company_name,
  p.merchant_tier,
  COUNT(o.id) as total_orders,
  SUM(o.total) as total_spent,
  COALESCE(mw.points_balance, 0) as current_points,
  COALESCE(mw.total_earned_points, 0) as lifetime_points
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN merchant_registrations mr ON mr.user_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.user_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN merchant_wallets mw ON mw.user_id = p.id
WHERE p.role = 'merchant'
GROUP BY p.id, p.full_name, mr.company_name, p.merchant_tier, mw.points_balance, mw.total_earned_points
ORDER BY total_spent DESC NULLS LAST;
```

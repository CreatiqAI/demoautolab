# Wallet & Promotions Completely Removed from User Navigation ✅

## What Was Done:

### 1. Removed from Header Navigation ✅
**File**: `src/components/Header.tsx`

**Removed**:
- ❌ Wallet link (desktop & mobile)
- ❌ Promotions link (desktop & mobile)
- ❌ All merchant checking logic
- ❌ isMerchant state
- ❌ useEffect for checking merchant status
- ❌ Unused imports (Wallet icon, supabase)

**Current Navigation** (for ALL logged-in users):
```
Desktop/Mobile:
├── Catalog
├── My Orders
└── My Vouchers
```

### 2. Routes Still Exist (Direct URL Access Only)
The pages still exist but are NOT in navigation:
- `/merchant/wallet` - Can only access by typing URL
- `/merchant/promotions` - Can only access by typing URL

**If you want to completely block access**, we would need to add route guards.

## Current State:

### For Any Logged-In User:
- ✅ Can see: Catalog, My Orders, My Vouchers
- ❌ Cannot see: Wallet, Promotions (removed from nav)

### Header Shows:
```
[Logo] Catalog | My Orders | My Vouchers ... [Cart] [Profile]
```

## Files Modified:

1. ✅ `src/components/Header.tsx`
   - Removed all Wallet/Promotions links
   - Removed merchant detection logic
   - Cleaned up unused code

## No More Issues:

- ✅ Simple navigation for all users
- ✅ No merchant checking
- ✅ No conditional rendering complexity
- ✅ Clean, straightforward header

## If Merchants Need Access to Wallet/Promotions:

They can either:
1. **Type URL directly**: `/merchant/wallet` or `/merchant/promotions`
2. **OR** Create separate merchant dashboard button/link later

## Next Steps (Optional):

If you want to add Wallet/Promotions back ONLY for merchants:
1. We can add a simple "Merchant Dashboard" button
2. Or add them to a dropdown menu
3. Or create separate merchant header component

For now: **Navigation is clean and simple for all users** ✅

-- =====================================================
-- FIX PREMIUM PARTNER ACCESS FOR ADMINS
-- =====================================================
-- Since admins don't use Supabase Auth, we need different approach
-- We'll grant direct SELECT/UPDATE privileges to authenticated role
-- and rely on application-level security

-- Drop existing RLS policies
